/**
 * React Query Client Configuration
 * 
 * Centralized QueryClient setup with optimized caching strategies:
 * - 5-minute stale time for analytics data
 * - 30-minute garbage collection time
 * - Disabled refetch on window focus (reduces unnecessary API calls)
 * - Built-in request deduplication (prevents React Strict Mode double-fetch)
 * - Retry logic for failed requests
 * 
 * Security: All queries require authentication via AuthContext
