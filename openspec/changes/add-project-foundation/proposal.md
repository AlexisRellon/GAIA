## Why

GAIA requires a solid foundation with all necessary dependencies, tooling, and project structure to begin development. Currently, the project has only documentation and OpenSpec setup, but lacks the actual codebase, dependencies, and development environment configuration needed for implementing the three-tiered architecture (Data Ingestion → AI Pipeline → PWA Frontend).

## What Changes

- Initialize project structure with `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `tests/` directories
- Set up Python environment with AI/ML dependencies (Climate-NLI, spaCy, NLTK, scikit-learn)
- Configure React + TailwindCSS frontend with PWA capabilities
- Install and configure Supabase CLI and integration
- Set up geospatial libraries (Leaflet/Mapbox preparation)
- Configure testing frameworks (Pytest for Python, Jest for React)
- Add development tooling (Black, ESLint, pre-commit hooks)
- Create environment configuration files (.env templates)
- Initialize package management (requirements.txt, package.json)

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: Creates new `project-setup` capability
- **Affected code**: Initializes entire codebase structure from scratch
- **Breaking changes**: None (greenfield project)
- **Dependencies**: Requires Node.js, Python 3.9+, npm/pip installed
- **Timeline**: Foundation setup before any feature development can begin

## Implementation Order

1. Directory structure and configuration files
2. Backend Python dependencies and virtual environment
3. Frontend React/TailwindCSS setup with PWA template
4. Supabase configuration and local development setup
5. Testing framework configuration
6. Development tooling and code quality tools
